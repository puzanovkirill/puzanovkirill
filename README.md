### 👋 hey, i'm kirill

frontend developer focused on clarity, structure, and stability.  
i build systems that stay readable, fixable, and kind to the next person.

currently building developer tools and business-facing systems -  
tools for those who build, platforms for those who operate.

mostly working with the web.  
primarily frontend, but i cross layers when needed - backend, infra, architecture.

i use AI in day-to-day development - to think faster, write cleaner, and explore deeper.  
tools assist, but intent remains human.

i explore how things break - and how to rebuild them better.  
sometimes with humor, always with intent.

---

### 🧠 how i think

- good code is quiet  
- interfaces should explain themselves  
- bugs are signals, not shame  
- backwards compatibility is a feature  
- stability is the real flex  
- growth is the only constant

---

### 📌 what i do

- design frontend architecture for change and clarity  
- share lessons from debugging and upgrades  
- explore tools that make dev work smoother  
- write for those who are figuring it out too

---

### 🛠️ tech stack

TypeScript, React, Next.js, RTK  
TailwindCSS, Chakra UI, feature-sliced design
