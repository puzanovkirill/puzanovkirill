### 👋 Hi, I’m Kirill

A developer who enjoys building stuff and sometimes even finishing it.

Writing code mostly for the web.  
Working at [3divi.ai](https://3divi.ai), building SDKs and developer tools.  
Always curious, occasionally productive.

---

### 💡 What I like to do:
- Making interfaces less annoying.  
- Exploring how things work under the hood.  
- Writing code that doesn't scare me (or others).  
- Learning new tools, breaking them, and fixing them.

---

### 🛠️ Also into:
- 🏀 Shooting hoops  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting things  
- 🎵 Making beats nobody hears  
- 🎮 Gaming for fun, not for ranking  
- 📖 Reading random dev stuff at 2 AM

---

Always building, always learning, sometimes shipping.
